### About the VICE Launcher project
VICE Launcher is a basic Open-Source program that replaces all of your shortcut icons to your diffrent VICE emulators with one. A simple launcher.  

### How to install
VICE Launcher is easy to install. Simply download the stable build or build it yourself with Visual Studio and place the executable in your VICE 3.1 installation directory.  

### Notes
This launcher was made to work with VICE 3.1. Because of that, i cannot gaurentee that it will work with older (or possibly newer) versions of VICE.

*NEWER VICE RELEASES HAVE BEEN MADE PUBLIC. THE ISSUES WILL BE ADDRESSED SOON.*
